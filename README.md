## Brenford's Law
Benford's Law is an observation about the distribution of the frequencies of the first digits of the numbers in many different data sets. It is frequently found that the first digits are not uniformly distributed, but follow the logarithmic distribution

</p>

That is, numbers starting with 1 are more common than those starting with 2, and so on, with those starting with 9 the least common. The probabilities are given below:

Benford's Law is most accurate for data sets which span several orders of magnitude, and can be proved to be exact for some infinite sequences of numbers.
